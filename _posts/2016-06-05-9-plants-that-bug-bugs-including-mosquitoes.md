Unfortunately, so will the bugs. And because of viruses such as Zika and West Nile, mosquitoes are a big concern. You can plant herbs and flowers that repel those bugs, including mosquitoes, and add a touch of beauty to your backyard.</p></article>

We have had some issues with ticks this year in our back yard, not a large number, but we never really had any before. This past winter played a part in that we did not have the usual "length of cold weather " that normally would kill the larvae.
